# Stable diffusion-image to promt

## Goal

The goal is to reverse the typical direction of a generative text-to-image model: instead of generating an image from a text prompt, creating a model which can predict the text prompt given a generated image, we will make predictions on a dataset containing a wide variety of (prompt, image) pairs generated by Stable Diffusion 2.0, in order to understand how reversible the latent relationship is.
